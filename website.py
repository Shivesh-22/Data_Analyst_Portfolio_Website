                 - My job as a data analyst is to find patterns and insights that are

                 its correctness and applicability.
                 - I then use statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms to draw relevant conclusions. My job goes beyond

                 that inform business expansion and strategic choices.
                 - Whether it's determining consumer behaviour, seeing market trends, or streamlining internal operations,
                 I use data to make insightful recommendations that improve effectiveness and
                 performance.
